      <p> My name is De Aunte Hall I was born in Seattle Wa. One thing that I
        <strong> LOVE </strong> is halloween. This is a picture I took one year as
        Pablo Escobar. I'm also really into big wheel bmx, I like to go on <em>"Ride Outs"</em> through the city
        when ever possible. I'm also a fater of two and being a Dad is the biggest and most fun part of my life.
